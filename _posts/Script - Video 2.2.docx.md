**Slide - Video Introduction**

Welcome to the video - Showing simple popups

In this video, we will learn about how to use message widget to show
popups in tkinter. We will see how you can use it, and we will see a
code demo and the working app in action.

The widget can be used to display short text messages. The message
widget is similar in its functionality to the Label widget, but it is
more flexible in displaying text, e.g. the font can be changed while the
Label widget can only display text in a single font. It provides a
multiline object, that is the text may span more than one line. The text
is automatically broken into lines and justified. We were ambiguous,
when we said, that the font of the message widget can be changed. This
means that we can choose arbitrarily a font for one widget, but the text
of this widget will be rendered solely in this font. This means that we
can't change the font within a widget. So it's not possible to have a
text in more than one font. If you need to display text in multiple
fonts, we suggest to use a Text widget.
