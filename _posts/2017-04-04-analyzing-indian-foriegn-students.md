Recently, in Indian Parliament, a Member of Parliament asked a question on how many students from India are studying in foreign countries and which country. Ministry of External Affairs provided the data here.

The data is in pdf format. I downloaded the data and converted it into a csv file. Here are some analysis & inferences about this data.
