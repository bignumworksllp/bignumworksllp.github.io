# Introduction

I have published multiple Video Courses on [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/harish-garg) over the last one year.

These are the tools i use to prepare and record them. This post is a WIP and will keep extending it and making it more detailed.

## Writing Code and Content

I use VSCode to write code and content most of the time. Sometimes, Jupyter Notebook is also used, specially for topics involving Data Analysis. For any R related topics, I use R Studio.

## Recording screen and audio

For recording screen and video/audio, I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)

## Slides 

I use the [PowerPoint via Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/h) for creation of slides for the videos.

## Audio recording Hardware

I use Snowball Mic for recording audio.
